# CPD-4414 Build It Samples for Lesson No.11
## Java Persistence API

This repo contains samples for a lesson based on the JPA with JAX-RS.

To retrieve these files and work with them:

1. Open NetBeans
2. Navigate to Team -> Git -> Clone... or Team -> Git -> Remote -> Clone...
3. Enter the Repository URL: https://github.com/ProfRussell/CPD4414-BuildIt11.git
4. Ensure the *Clone Into:* folder is on the F: Drive
5. Hit Finish, Work from There

## Note:

1. On a fully updated version of NetBeans (8.0.2), this requires an additional step to add cdi-api.jar due to [Bug ID# 247013](https://netbeans.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=247013)
2. The NetBeans + GlassFish connection is still rocky, and the MySQL JDBC objects may need to be applied manually in the GlassFish Domain Admin console
